fixed the free money bug -- issue was the preallocated values were being added to the players total resources, but then not subtracted back out if the total post-allocated values were to large and an error was thrown. I now subtract them back if there isn't enough money or time to complete the campaning/advertising.

it now shows the national map again after the end of the game, but only after you close a blank panel that pops up, I'm not sure why.

looking at the local fundraising function, I reset the exponent multiplier to 1/50 from 1/100, and it seems like the values are a bit more reasonable, at least for a 10 week game. possibly still kind of low though. 

added an autosave that saves a game at the start of every turn

it seems like momentum should affect fundraising, maybe particularly local fundraising? */added, also seems to increases the numbers by what I think is a reasonable amount, at least for the ten week game.

momentum needs to be reworked so that a single win on a small day is more influential than a sinle win on a big day. I had already done this, I made it a more pronounced effect. As long as the momentum numbers work in the other equations I think it's in pretty good shape now. The other thing that could be worth thinking about is a time based factor, so Iowa matters more than, say, connecticut, but I don't know if that actually makes sense to do.
currently a clean sweep of super tuesday gets you about 3 times the momentum of a win in Iowa, which is just slightly more than a win in New Hampshire


If I ever add the county level census data, it could be fun to scale fundraising from districts based on average district income

there appears to be a bug if you don't have enough money for add buys it refunds some of the money and keeps the previous level of add buys present, something that needs to be checked.

the first complete game was mostly a sucess, dada won

I'm guessing the results winner being wrong and the wrong person being painted on the national are from the same source. It looks like its coming from state.support, I should check the generation of that number
it might be the difference between state.support and state.pollingAverage, which should probably be what's used in the painting.
that didn't seem to help.

now any left over time at the end of the turn will be put into fundraising

what does the AI need to do?
    decide where to build org
    where to buy ads
    where to campaign
    how much time to spend fundraising

the overall goal is to maximize delegates
